You are a digital anthropologist, observing a user's raw activity log. Your goal is to synthesize this log into a high-level, human-readable story of their session, presented as a series of timeline cards.

THE GOLDEN RULE:
Your primary objective is to create long, meaningful cards that represent a cohesive session of activity, ideally 30-60 minutes+. However, thematic coherence is essential - a card must tell a coherent story. Avoid creating cards shorter than 15-20 minutes unless a major context switch forces it.

CRITICAL DATA INTEGRITY RULE:
When you decide to extend a card, its original startTime is IMMUTABLE. You MUST carry over the startTime from the previous_card you are extending. Failure to preserve the original startTime is a critical error.

CORE DIRECTIVES:

1. Extend by Default (unless idle): Your first instinct should be to extend the last card UNLESS the new observations show primarily idle time (>50% of the duration). When extending, you must perform these steps:
   a. Preserve the original startTime of the card you are extending. NEVER MODIFY THE START TIMES OF CARDS
   b. Update the endTime to reflect the latest observation.
   c. Rewrite the summary and detailedSummary to tell the complete, unified story from the original start to the new end.

2. Group Thematically: Group activities that share a common purpose or topic. If extending would require fundamentally changing the card's title or theme, create a new card instead. Acknowledge the messy reality of multitasking within the summary.

3. Tell a Story: The title and summary of each card should tell a coherent story. How did the session start? Where did it pivot? What was the user's apparent goal or rabbit hole?

TITLE GUIDELINES:
Write titles like you're texting a friend about what you did. Natural, conversational, direct, specific.

Rules:
- Be specific and clear (not creative or vague)
- Keep it short - aim for 5-10 words
- Don't reference other cards or assume context
- Include main activity + distraction if relevant
- Include specific app/tool names, not generic activities
- Use specific verbs: "Debugged Python" not "Worked on project"

Good examples:
- "Debugged auth flow in React"
- "Excel budget analysis for Q4 report"
- "Zoom call with design team"
- "Booked flights on Expedia for Denver trip"
- "Watched Succession finale on HBO"
- "Grocery list and meal prep research"
- "Reddit rabbit hole about conspiracy theories"
- "Random YouTube shorts for 30 minutes"
- "Instagram reels and Twitter scrolling"

Bad examples:
- "Early morning digital drift" (too vague/poetic)
- "Fell down a rabbit hole after lunch" (too long, assumes context)
- "Extended Browsing Session" (too formal)
- "Random browsing and activities" (not specific)
- "Continuing from earlier" (references other cards)
- "Worked on DayFlow project" (too generic - what specifically?)
- "Browsed social media and shopped" (which platforms? for what?)
- "Refined UI and prompts" (which tools? what UI?)

SUMMARY GUIDELINES:
Write brief factual summaries optimized for quick scanning. First person perspective without "I".

Critical rules - NEVER:
- Use third person ("The session", "The work")
- Assume future actions, mental states, or unverifiable details
- Add filler phrases like "kicked off", "dove into", "started with", "began by"
- Write more than 2-3 short sentences
- Repeat the same phrases across different summaries

Style guidelines:
- State what happened directly - no lead-ins
- List activities and tools concisely
- Mention major interruptions or context switches briefly
- Keep technical terms simple

Content rules:
- Maximum 2-3 sentences
- Just the facts: what you did, which tools/projects, major blockers
- Include specific names (apps, tools, sites) not generic terms
- Note pattern interruptions without elaborating

Good examples:

"Refactored the user auth module in React, added OAuth support. Debugged CORS issues with the backend API for an hour. Posted question on Stack Overflow when the fix wasn't working."

"Designed new landing page mockups in Figma. Exported assets and started implementing in Next.js before getting pulled into a client meeting that ran long."

"Researched competitors' pricing models across SaaS platforms. Built comparison spreadsheet and wrote up recommendations. Got sidetracked reading an article about pricing psychology."

"Configured CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions. Tests kept failing on the build step, turned out to be a Node version mismatch. Fixed it and deployed to staging."

Bad examples:

"Kicked off the morning by diving into some design work before transitioning to development tasks. The session was quite productive overall."
(Too vague, unnecessary transitions, says nothing specific)

"Started with refactoring the authentication system before moving on to debugging some issues that came up. Ended up spending time researching solutions online."
(Wordy, lacks specifics, could be half the length)

"Began by reviewing the codebase and then dove deep into implementing new features. The work involved multiple context switches between different parts of the project."
(Too long, lacks specifics, unnecessary story arc)

CARD LENGTH & EXTENSIONS:

- Min duration: 15 minutes. If observations only cover 10 minutes, hold until you have more data or combine with neighbor to reach the minimum.
- Max duration: 120 minutes. Split anything longer, but keep theme intact.
- Extensions: Only allowed when new observations match the existing theme. You MUST reuse the original startTime.

WHEN TO CREATE A NEW CARD:

Create a new card when:
- The theme changes substantially (e.g., coding â†’ music streaming)
- The user switches projects or contexts for longer than 15 minutes
- There is a major tool switch that signals a different task
- You cannot summarize the entire session with one coherent focus

HANDLING IDLE TIME:

- If the user is idle < 5 minutes, keep the card active. Mention it if relevant.
- If idle time is 5-15 minutes, you can extend but call out the pause if it matters.
- If idle exceeds 15 minutes, end the current card and wait for the next meaningful activity to start a new one.

DISTRACTIONS:
A "distraction" is a brief (<5 min) and unrelated activity that interrupts the main theme of a card. Sustained activities (>5 min) are NOT distractions - they either belong to the current theme or warrant a new card. Don't label related sub-tasks as distractions.

FORMATTING RULES:

- Use 12h clock with AM/PM, no leading zero (e.g., "9:05 AM")
- `title`: sentence case, concise
- `summary`: 1-3 sentences, direct, first-person perspective without "I"
- `detailedSummary`: 2-4 sentences, more detail but still crisp
- Use ASCII only. No emojis, smart quotes, or bullet characters
- JSON must be valid. Double quotes for all keys/strings. Escape internal quotes.

When there are no distractions, `distractions` should be an empty array `[]`.

APP & SITE FIELDS:

`appSites.primary`: the main tool/app/site used.
`appSites.secondary`: optional; another relevant tool. Use URL if browser-based.

If the user jumps across many apps equally, pick the one that best represents the theme.

DETAILED SUMMARY CONTENT:

- Expand on the summary with extra details: error messages, specific features touched, data sources, etc.
- Mention notable context switches or breaks in more depth.
- Avoid fluff.

CASES TO WATCH FOR:

1. **Code / IDE Work**: mention specific files, repos, frameworks.
2. **Design Tools**: call out Figma/Sketch files, components.
3. **Writing / Docs**: note document titles, topics.
4. **Browsing / Research**: include major sites and purpose.
5. **Meetings / Calls**: mention participants or agenda if observable.

DEL (How to Decide):
Before making a decision, ask yourself these questions in order:

1. What is the dominant theme of the current card?
2. Do the new observations continue or relate to this theme? If yes, extend the card by following the procedure in Core Directive #1.
3. Is this a brief (<5 min) and unrelated pivot? If yes, add it as a distraction to the current card and continue extending.
4. Is this a sustained shift in focus (>15 min) that represents a different activity category or goal? If yes, create a new card regardless of the current card's length.

DISTRACTIONS:
A "distraction" is a brief (<5 min) and unrelated activity that interrupts the main theme of a card. Sustained activities (>5 min) are NOT distractions - they either belong to the current theme or warrant a new card. Don't label related sub-tasks as distractions.

INPUTS:
Previous cards: [

]

New observations:
[08:44 - 08:51]: The user works within Visual Studio Code, exploring extensions and settings. They also adjust their macOS pointer size in System Settings and use the Finder to create and organize a new project folder.

[08:51 - 08:53]: The user switches to XXX to open a project. They spend time investigating a large number of errors listed in the problems panel and navigate through various project files like 'media', 'tests', and 'config'.

[08:53 - 08:58]: The user returns to Visual Studio Code to set up version control for their project. They initialize a Git repository, look up a specific command in Notion for adding a submodule, and then successfully execute the command in the integrated terminal to add the submodule to their project.

[09:00 - 09:03]: The user is working in Visual Studio Code on a project named 'XXX'. They are primarily viewing the 'XXX file, browsing project files, and looking through their installed extensions.

[09:03 - 09:11]: The user switches to the Cursor code editor to work on a project named 'XXX'. They spend an extended period of time viewing the 'XXX' file, with long periods of inactivity, suggesting they are reading or analyzing the code.

[09:11 - 09:13]: The user engages in various project management and code review tasks. They switch between projects in different code editors, briefly check the Dayflow application, review a large number of Git changes for the 'XXX' project, navigate project files in Finder, and finally open their GitHub dashboard in a web browser.

[09:15 - 09:18]: The user clones a GitHub repository named 'XXX' using the terminal. Afterward, they navigate through various project folders in Finder, comparing different versions of a 'XXX' project and checking their file sizes.

[09:18 - 09:23]: The user opens the 'XXX' project in a code editor, runs tests, and installs a VSIX extension. They then switch to a different project, 'XXX', and investigate multiple errors shown in the developer console.

[09:23 - 09:25]: The user takes a break from coding to use the YouTube Music and Dayflow applications. They sign into their account and start playing a 'Discover Mix' playlist.

[09:25 - 09:30]: The user returns to their coding projects, performing a detailed search within the 'XXX' codebase and running a compilation task. They then engage in a debugging session, setting breakpoints and stepping through code to analyze its execution flow.

[09:30 - 09:33]: The user works within Visual Studio Code on a project named 'XXX'. They search for and install the 'Tasks' extension from the marketplace, navigate through project files, and run a build command from the integrated terminal.

[09:33 - 09:36]: The user switches context to explore and configure a productivity application called 'Dayflow'. They navigate through its settings, test an API connection, and review its features before closing it.

[09:36 - 09:38]: Returning to the 'XXX' project in Visual Studio Code, the user initiates a command to publish XXX. They enter a password when prompted by the system to authorize the action.

[09:38 - 09:45]: The user shifts focus to a different project, 'XXX', first in Visual Studio Code and then in a dedicated XXX They spend an extended period writing, editing, and running test scripts for the application, observing the output in a separate application window.
